# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was created to provide bootcamp students a central location to review notes related to the diffetent topics covered in prework material. I built this project because as an individual comeing from a completely different sector of the workforce with no coding experience, a webpage that I can refer to when needed would be of huge assistance in pursuing proficiency in coding. This webpage provides a central location for study material as opposed to having to refer to different materials such as multiple notebooks or apps to find information. As a beginner, I was exposed to the process of building a webpage as well as the programs needed to build a webpage and how to operate them
